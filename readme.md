## Jeff's Trivia Game

**Trivia Game Description**
This project created a multiple choice trivia game.
Once the user clicks "_Begin a New Game_" the program displays a trivia question and four answers.
The user simply clicks on the correct answer and the game will indicate if they are correct.
The game displays a running score of how many questions were answered correctly.
After each question, the user clicks the "_Next Question_" button to continue.
After completing a round of ten questions, the program displays the score and the user has the option to play another round of ten questions or begin the game all over again.
